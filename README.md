# macinit

A small script which you can execute which sets up the basics tools useful for a
freshly-installed mac.

Specifically, it installs the following:

- The xcode command line tools
- pip, the PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages
- battleschool, which is an environment provisioning tool similar to boxen, allowing
  the install of programs/dependencies using a set of declarative config files

To start, run the following in a terminal:

    $ curl -L https://raw.github.com/OldhamMade/macinit/master/init.sh | sh

...and go grab a coffee!

Once these steps have completed, you can head over to [battleschool](https://github.com/spencergibb/battleschool) to kick off your
main install.
